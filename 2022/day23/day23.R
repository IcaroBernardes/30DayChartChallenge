## Defining the plot font (installed beforehand from Google Fonts)

# 1. Data download, load and handling

## Renames and keeps only relevant data
df <- rawdata %>%

## Converts the data to lumen-hour per pound
df <- df %>% dplyr::mutate(Energy = 1000000/Price)

## Creates a new variable in 0-1 scale
df <- df %>% dplyr::mutate(scaled = scales::rescale(Energy))

## Defines lightness of the tiles

## Defines coordinates for the titles

  ### Defines breaks for the x-axis

  ### Eliminates and customizes plot elements
  theme_void() +
